### Main Components

- **MainPage**: The homepage where users can view their books categorized into shelves.
- **SearchBooks**: The search page where users can find new books to add to their collection.
- **Book**: The individual book component that displays a book's details (title, author, image).

---

## Usage

1. **Main Page**: 
   - On the main page, books are categorized into three sections: **Currently Reading**, **Want to Read**, and **Read**.
   - You can move books by selecting the desired shelf from the dropdown menu.

2. **Search Page**: 
   - Navigate to the search page by clicking the "Search Books" button.
   - Use the search bar to look for books by title or author.

## State Management

The application uses **React's \`useState\` hook** to manage the state of the books. It saves the current book list to the browser's **localStorage**, ensuring that the user's selections persist even after a page refresh.

---

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: The main library used to build the UI.
- **React Router**: For navigation between different pages (Main Page and Search Page).
- **HTML5/CSS3**: For structure and styling.
- **localStorage**: To persist data between page refreshes.
